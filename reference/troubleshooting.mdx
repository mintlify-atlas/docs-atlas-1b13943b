description: Common issues, error messages, and solutions when tracing URL redirects
---

This page covers common errors you may encounter when using Redirect Trace and how to resolve them.

## Error messages

### Request timeout after {timeout}ms

**Cause:** The HTTP request took longer than your configured timeout setting.

```typescript
if (fetchError.name === "AbortError") {
  errorMessage = `Request timeout after ${timeout}ms`;
}
```

**Solutions:**

<Accordion title="Increase timeout setting">
  1. Open Raycast Settings
  2. Navigate to Extensions > Redirect Trace
  3. Increase "Timeout (ms)" value (try `10000` for 10 seconds)
  4. Retry the trace
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check network connection">
  - Verify you have internet connectivity
  - Try accessing the URL in a browser
  - Check if you're behind a proxy or VPN that may slow requests
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Server may be slow">
  Some servers intentionally delay responses. If the URL works in a browser but times out in Redirect Trace, increase the timeout setting.
</Accordion>

### DNS resolution failed - domain not found

**Cause:** The domain name could not be resolved to an IP address.

```typescript
if (fetchError.message.includes("ENOTFOUND")) {
  errorMessage = "DNS resolution failed - domain not found";
}
```

**Solutions:**

<Accordion title="Verify the URL">
  - Check for typos in the domain name
  - Ensure the domain actually exists (try in a browser)
  - Verify you included the correct TLD (.com, .org, etc.)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="DNS issues">
  - Your DNS server may be having issues
  - Try using a different DNS service (Google DNS: 8.8.8.8)
  - Restart your network connection
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Domain expired or deleted">
  The domain may no longer exist. Verify in a web browser or use a WHOIS lookup service.
</Accordion>

### Connection refused by server

**Cause:** The server actively rejected the connection attempt.

```typescript
if (fetchError.message.includes("ECONNREFUSED")) {
  errorMessage = "Connection refused by server";
}
```

**Solutions:**

<Accordion title="Server may be down">
  - The server might be offline or not accepting connections
  - Try accessing the URL in a browser to verify
  - Check if the service has a status page
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Port or protocol issues">
  - Ensure you're using the correct protocol (http vs https)
  - The service may not be running on standard ports
  - Try switching between `http://` and `https://`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Firewall blocking">
  Your firewall or the server's firewall may be blocking the connection. Try from a different network.
</Accordion>

### SSL certificate error

**Cause:** The server's SSL/TLS certificate is invalid, expired, or untrusted.

```typescript
if (fetchError.message.includes("certificate")) {
  errorMessage = "SSL certificate error";
}
```

**Solutions:**

<Accordion title="Certificate issues">
  - The SSL certificate may be expired
  - Certificate may be self-signed
  - Certificate may not match the domain name
  - Try accessing with `http://` instead (if appropriate)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="System time issues">
  - Verify your system clock is set correctly
  - SSL validation can fail if your system time is wrong
</Accordion>

<Warning>
  If you encounter SSL errors on legitimate sites, contact the site administrator. Do not attempt to bypass certificate validation.
</Warning>

### Network request failed - possible CORS or security restriction

**Cause:** Generic fetch failure, often related to CORS policies or security restrictions.

```typescript
if (fetchError.message.includes("Failed to fetch")) {
  errorMessage = "Network request failed - possible CORS or security restriction";
}
```

**Solutions:**

<Accordion title="CORS restrictions">
  Some servers block requests from non-browser clients. This is a server-side restriction that cannot be bypassed from Redirect Trace.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network issues">
  - Check your internet connection
  - Try disabling VPN if enabled
  - Try from a different network
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Security software">
  Antivirus or security software may be blocking the request. Temporarily disable to test.
</Accordion>

### CORS policy blocked the request

**Cause:** Server explicitly blocked the request due to CORS policy.

```typescript
if (fetchError.message.includes("CORS")) {
  errorMessage = "CORS policy blocked the request";
}
```

**Solutions:**

<Accordion title="Server-side restriction">
  The server is configured to only accept requests from specific origins. This cannot be fixed from the client side.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Alternative approach">
  - Try accessing the URL in a web browser instead
  - Contact the site owner if you need API access
  - Use browser developer tools to trace redirects manually
</Accordion>

## Common issues

### Incomplete redirect chain

**Symptom:** The trace shows "Incomplete" status and stops before reaching the final destination.

**Causes:**

1. **Hit maxRedirects limit** - The chain exceeded your configured maximum
2. **Missing location header** - A 3xx response didn't include a `location` header
3. **Malformed location header** - The redirect URL couldn't be parsed

**Solutions:**

<Accordion title="Increase maxRedirects">
  1. Open Raycast Settings > Extensions > Redirect Trace
  2. Increase "Max Redirects" (try `15` or `20`)
  3. Retry the trace
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check for broken redirects">
  If the chain stops at a redirect status (301, 302) but no location header exists, the server has a misconfiguration. Report to the site owner.
</Accordion>

### Long URLs not pasting

**Symptom:** URLs over 500 characters won't paste into the search bar.

**Solution:**

<Accordion title="Use clipboard feature">
  1. Copy the long URL to your clipboard
  2. Open Redirect Trace
  3. Use the "Check Clipboard" action (Cmd+V)
  4. Select "Trace This URL"
</Accordion>

This is intentional behavior - the search bar has input limits, but the clipboard feature handles URLs of any length.

### Redirects work in browser but fail in Redirect Trace

**Causes:**

1. **User-Agent blocking** - Server only accepts browser user agents
2. **JavaScript redirects** - Page uses client-side redirects
3. **Cookie requirements** - Server requires cookies to be set

**Solutions:**

<Accordion title="User-Agent blocking">
  Redirect Trace sends: `RedirectTrace-Raycast-Extension/1.0`
  
  Some servers block non-browser user agents. This is a server-side restriction.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="JavaScript redirects">
  Redirect Trace only follows HTTP redirects (3xx status codes). It cannot execute JavaScript that performs client-side redirects.
  
  Use browser developer tools for JavaScript-based redirects.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cookie-based redirects">
  Some sites require cookies to be set before redirecting. Redirect Trace doesn't maintain cookie state between requests.
</Accordion>

### Tracking parameters not removed

**Symptom:** The "Clean URL" still contains tracking parameters.

**Explanation:**

The `cleanTrackingParams()` function removes 50+ known tracking parameters and uses heuristics for unknown ones. However, custom or proprietary tracking parameters may not be detected.

**Parameters removed:**
- Google Analytics: `utm_*`, `gclid`, `_ga`
- Facebook: `fbclid`, `fb_*`
- Email marketing: `mc_cid`, `_hsenc`, `mkt_tok`
- Many more - see [API reference](/reference/api#cleantrackingparams)

**If parameters remain:**

<Accordion title="Custom tracking parameters">
  If you encounter parameters that should be removed but aren't, these may be custom to that site. You can manually remove them or report them for inclusion in future versions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Functional parameters">
  Some parameters that look like tracking may actually be functional (session IDs, authentication tokens). The cleaner deliberately preserves short parameters and those that may affect functionality.
</Accordion>

## Debugging tips

### View full error details

1. When an error occurs, check the "Error" section in the results
2. Use "Copy Error" action (Cmd+C) to get the full error message
3. Check the last successful step in the redirect chain to see where it failed

### Inspect headers

For each redirect step:

1. Select the step in the redirect chain
2. Use "Copy Headers" action (Cmd+Shift+C)
3. Examine the `location` header to see the redirect target
4. Check `cache-control`, `set-cookie`, and other headers for clues

### Compare with browser

Use browser developer tools to compare:

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Enter the URL
4. Compare redirect chain with Redirect Trace results
5. Look for differences in headers or behavior

### Test with simpler URLs

<Accordion title="Isolate the issue">
  If a complex URL fails:
  
  1. Try the base domain without parameters
  2. Add parameters one at a time
  3. Identify which parameter or path causes the failure
  4. This helps determine if it's a URL encoding issue or server behavior
</Accordion>

## Still having issues?

If you encounter persistent problems:

1. **Verify prerequisites:**
   - Active internet connection
   - Latest version of Redirect Trace
   - Latest version of Raycast

2. **Collect information:**
   - Full error message (use "Copy Error" action)
   - URL being traced (if shareable)
   - Your timeout and maxRedirects settings
   - Steps that lead to the error

3. **Test workarounds:**
   - Try from a different network
   - Increase timeout and maxRedirects
   - Test with browser developer tools
   - Verify the URL is accessible in a standard browser

<Warning>
  If the URL contains sensitive information or authentication tokens, do not share it publicly. Instead, test with a similar public URL to demonstrate the issue.
