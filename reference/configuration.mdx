description: Configure Redirect Trace preferences to customize redirect tracing behavior
---

You can customize Redirect Trace behavior through extension preferences. Access preferences through Raycast Settings > Extensions > Redirect Trace.

## Preferences

<ParamField path="maxRedirects" type="number" default="10">
  Maximum number of redirects to follow before stopping the trace.

  **Type:** Textfield  
  **Required:** No  
  **Default:** `10`

  Controls how many redirect hops the extension will follow in a chain. When the limit is reached, the trace stops and marks the chain as incomplete.

  <Accordion title="When to adjust this setting">
    - **Increase** if you encounter legitimate redirect chains that exceed 10 hops (rare but possible with complex marketing campaigns)
    - **Decrease** if you want faster results and don't need to follow long chains
    - Keep default for most use cases
  </Accordion>

  <Warning>
    Setting this value too high may result in longer processing times or potential infinite redirect loops consuming resources.
  </Warning>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="timeout" type="number" default="5000">
  Request timeout in milliseconds for each HTTP request in the redirect chain.

  **Type:** Textfield  
  **Required:** No  
  **Default:** `5000` (5 seconds)

  Sets how long to wait for each HTTP request before aborting with a timeout error. This applies to each step in the redirect chain, not the total trace time.

  <Accordion title="When to adjust this setting">
    - **Increase** if you're tracing URLs with slow-responding servers
    - **Decrease** if you want faster failure detection for unreachable servers
    - **Network considerations:** Slower connections may require higher values
  </Accordion>

  <Warning>
    Values below 3000ms (3 seconds) may cause premature timeouts on slower networks or servers.
  </Warning>
</ParamField>

## Configuration in code

The extension reads preferences using the Raycast API:

```typescript
import { getPreferenceValues } from "@raycast/api";

interface Preferences {
  maxRedirects: string;
  timeout: string;
}

const preferences = getPreferenceValues<Preferences>();
const maxRedirects = parseInt(preferences.maxRedirects || "10", 10);
const timeout = parseInt(preferences.timeout || "5000", 10);
```

## Default behavior

When preferences are not explicitly set:

- Extension follows up to 10 redirects per chain
- Each request times out after 5 seconds
- Chains exceeding limits are marked as incomplete
- Timeout errors display: `Request timeout after {timeout}ms`

## Examples

<Accordion title="Tracing complex marketing campaigns">
  Some marketing URLs pass through multiple tracking services:
  
  **Recommended settings:**
  - Max Redirects: `15`
  - Timeout: `7000`
  
  This handles campaigns with 10+ redirect hops while accommodating slower tracking servers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Quick validation on fast networks">
  For simple redirect checks on reliable infrastructure:
  
  **Recommended settings:**
  - Max Redirects: `5`
  - Timeout: `3000`
  
  Provides faster results when you don't need to follow long chains.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Debugging slow or unreliable servers">
  When working with servers that have slow response times:
  
  **Recommended settings:**
  - Max Redirects: `10` (default)
  - Timeout: `10000`
  
  Gives servers more time to respond while maintaining reasonable redirect limits.
</Accordion>
