Redirect Trace helps marketers understand how their links work, identify performance bottlenecks, and verify tracking implementation. Use it to optimize campaigns and improve click-through rates.

## Campaign analysis

Analyze your marketing campaigns by tracing the redirect chains from email, social media, and paid ads to landing pages.

### Understanding your redirect chain

A typical marketing link redirect chain looks like this:

```
bit.ly/campaign
  ↓
email-platform.com/click?tracking=abc123
  ↓
yoursite.com/promo?utm_source=email&utm_campaign=spring2024
  ↓
yoursite.com/promo (after tracking parameters are processed)
```

Each redirect adds latency and potential drop-off points. Use Redirect Trace to identify unnecessary steps.

<Info>
Research shows that each additional redirect in a marketing link increases load time by 200-400ms and can reduce conversion rates by 2-3%. Keep your redirect chains short.
</Info>

## Link optimization

Identify and eliminate unnecessary redirects that slow down your marketing links and hurt conversion rates.

### Common redirect bottlenecks

<Accordion title="Multiple URL shorteners">
**Problem:** Using multiple URL shorteners in sequence creates unnecessary redirects.

**Example:**
```
bit.ly/abc → tinyurl.com/xyz → yoursite.com
```

**Solution:** Use only one URL shortener, or better yet, use your own domain for branded short links.

**Impact:** Removing one redirect can improve load time by 300ms and reduce drop-off by 2-5%.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Marketing platform redirects">
**Problem:** Email platforms (Mailchimp, SendGrid) and social schedulers add tracking redirects.

**Example:**
```
email-platform.com/click?id=123
  → analytics-platform.com/track?campaign=abc
  → yoursite.com
```

**Solution:** Minimize tracking layers by consolidating analytics platforms, or use UTM parameters instead of redirect-based tracking.

**Impact:** Can reduce total redirects from 5+ to 2-3, significantly improving click-through experience.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="HTTP to HTTPS redirects">
**Problem:** Links that start with HTTP redirect to HTTPS, adding an extra step.

**Example:**
```
http://yoursite.com/promo → https://yoursite.com/promo
```

**Solution:** Always use HTTPS in your marketing links from the start.

**Impact:** Eliminates one redirect and improves perceived page load speed.
</Accordion>

### Optimization workflow

1. **Trace your campaign links** - Copy your marketing URLs and trace them in Redirect Trace
2. **Count the redirects** - Check the "Redirect Count" in the summary
3. **Identify unnecessary steps** - Look for duplicate tracking, multiple shorteners, or HTTP redirects
4. **Test alternatives** - Create optimized versions and trace them to verify fewer redirects
5. **Measure impact** - Compare click-through rates and conversion rates before and after optimization

<Info>
Aim for 0-2 redirects in your marketing links. More than 3 redirects indicates optimization opportunities.
</Info>

## UTM parameter inspection

Inspect and verify UTM parameters and other tracking codes in your marketing links to ensure proper attribution.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Parameter verification" icon="check">
    Confirm UTM parameters (source, medium, campaign) are present and correctly formatted at each redirect step
  </Card>
  <Card title="Parameter preservation" icon="link">
    Verify that UTM parameters survive through redirect chains and reach your analytics platform
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Common UTM parameters

Redirect Trace automatically detects and can clean these tracking parameters:

- **utm_source** - Identifies the traffic source (google, newsletter, facebook)
- **utm_medium** - Identifies the marketing medium (email, cpc, social)
- **utm_campaign** - Identifies the specific campaign (spring_sale, product_launch)
- **utm_term** - Identifies paid search keywords
- **utm_content** - Differentiates similar content or links in the same ad

### Parameter inspection workflow

When tracing marketing links, check for:

1. **Parameter presence** - Are UTM parameters added at the expected step?
2. **Parameter persistence** - Do parameters survive through all redirects?
3. **Parameter conflicts** - Are different tracking systems adding conflicting parameters?
4. **Parameter bloat** - Are unnecessary tracking codes making URLs too long?

<Accordion title="Example: Debugging missing UTM parameters">
**Scenario:** Your Google Analytics shows "(direct)" traffic instead of "email campaign" for your newsletter links.

**Investigation with Redirect Trace:**

1. Trace your email newsletter link
2. Check each redirect step
3. Identify where UTM parameters are lost

**Common causes:**
- URL shortener strips parameters (solution: use a different shortener)
- Landing page redirects to another page without preserving parameters
- JavaScript redirect that doesn't carry query parameters forward

**Fix:** Modify your link structure to preserve parameters through all redirects.
</Accordion>

## Clean URL extraction

Extract clean versions of your landing pages without tracking parameters for sharing or testing.

### When to use clean URLs

- **Internal sharing** - Share clean versions with your team without tracking noise
- **A/B testing** - Create control URLs without tracking to test against tracked versions
- **Social proof** - Share cleaner-looking URLs in social media when tracking isn't needed
- **Documentation** - Use clean URLs in product documentation and help articles

### Extracting clean URLs

Use the "Copy Clean URL" action (⌘⇧L) to get a version with all tracking parameters removed:

**Original tracked URL:**
```
https://yoursite.com/product?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=launch&fbclid=abc123&gclid=xyz789&mc_cid=abc&_ga=def456
```

**Clean URL:**
```
https://yoursite.com/product
```

<Info>
Redirect Trace removes 40+ common tracking parameters including Google Analytics, Facebook, UTM codes, email marketing platforms, and more.

## Campaign performance insights

Use redirect chain analysis to understand and improve campaign performance:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Redirect latency" icon="clock">
    Measure how long each redirect takes by comparing timestamps - slower redirects hurt conversion rates
  </Card>
  <Card title="Drop-off analysis" icon="chart-line-down">
    More redirects = more opportunities for users to abandon - minimize redirect count for critical campaigns
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mobile vs desktop" icon="mobile">
    Mobile users are more sensitive to redirect latency - test your links on mobile devices specifically
  </Card>
  <Card title="Geographic routing" icon="globe">
    Identify if your links redirect differently based on location - important for international campaigns
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Integration with marketing tools

Use Redirect Trace alongside your existing marketing stack:

- **Before launching campaigns** - Trace all links in your email templates, landing pages, and ads
- **During campaign optimization** - Compare redirect chains between high and low-performing variants
- **Post-campaign analysis** - Review redirect patterns in your most successful campaigns
- **Link audits** - Regularly audit your marketing links to catch broken redirects or added latency

### Workflow example

1. **Export links from your email platform** (Mailchimp, HubSpot, etc.)
2. **Trace each link** in Redirect Trace
3. **Copy full chain reports** (⌘⌥C) for documentation
4. **Identify optimization opportunities** based on redirect count
5. **Implement changes** and verify with another trace
6. **Monitor performance** with your analytics platform

<Info>
Create a spreadsheet to track redirect counts for all your marketing links over time. This helps you catch when platforms add new tracking redirects that hurt performance.
