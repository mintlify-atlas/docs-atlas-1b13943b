---

Redirect Trace helps developers debug redirect logic, test API behavior, analyze SEO implications, and verify correct implementation of redirects in applications.

## API testing

Test and debug redirect behavior in your APIs and web applications by tracing how your endpoints handle redirects.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Endpoint verification" icon="server">
    Verify that API endpoints return correct redirect status codes (301, 302, 307, 308) for different scenarios
  </Card>
  <Card title="Redirect logic" icon="code-branch">
    Test conditional redirect logic based on authentication, location, device type, or other factors
  </Card>
  <Card title="Header inspection" icon="list">
    Inspect HTTP headers at each redirect step to debug cookie, authentication, and CORS issues
  </Card>
  <Card title="Status codes" icon="circle-check">
    Verify correct HTTP status codes throughout the redirect chain for proper browser and crawler behavior
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Common API redirect patterns

<Accordion title="Authentication redirects">
**Use case:** Testing login flows and protected resource redirects.

**Example redirect chain:**
```
GET /protected-resource
  → 302 Found
  → Location: /login?redirect=/protected-resource

GET /login?redirect=/protected-resource
  → (User logs in)
  → 302 Found
  → Location: /protected-resource

GET /protected-resource
  → 200 OK
```

**Testing with Redirect Trace:**
- Verify the redirect parameter is preserved correctly
- Check that the final destination matches the original requested resource
- Confirm status codes are appropriate (302 for temporary redirects)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="URL normalization">
**Use case:** Testing canonical URL redirects and slug normalization.

**Example redirect chain:**
```
GET /Product-Name-With-Caps
  → 301 Moved Permanently
  → Location: /product-name-with-caps

GET /product-name-with-caps
  → 200 OK
```

**Testing with Redirect Trace:**
- Verify 301 (permanent) is used for SEO-friendly redirects
- Confirm only one redirect is needed (no redirect chains)
- Check that the final URL matches your canonical format
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API versioning">
**Use case:** Testing API version redirects and deprecation flows.

**Example redirect chain:**
```
GET /api/v1/users
  → 308 Permanent Redirect
  → Location: /api/v2/users
  → Header: Sunset: Sat, 31 Dec 2024 23:59:59 GMT

GET /api/v2/users
  → 200 OK
```

**Testing with Redirect Trace:**
- Verify 308 status code preserves HTTP method (POST, PUT, etc.)
- Check deprecation headers are present
- Confirm new API version endpoint is correct
</Accordion>

### Development workflow

Use Redirect Trace during development to verify redirect implementation:

1. **Deploy to staging** - Deploy your redirect logic to a test environment
2. **Trace test URLs** - Copy your test URLs and trace them in Redirect Trace
3. **Verify status codes** - Check that redirects use correct status codes (301 vs 302 vs 307 vs 308)
4. **Inspect headers** - Review response headers for correct Location, Cache-Control, and custom headers
5. **Test edge cases** - Trace URLs with special characters, query parameters, and different formats
6. **Document behavior** - Use "Copy Full Chain Report" to document expected behavior

<Info>
Different redirect status codes have different semantic meanings. Use 301/308 for permanent redirects (SEO and caching benefits) and 302/307 for temporary redirects.
</Info>

## SEO analysis

Analyze how redirects affect SEO by identifying redirect chains, checking status codes, and verifying canonical URLs.

### SEO redirect best practices

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Use 301 for permanent redirects" icon="link-slash">
    When a page has permanently moved, use 301 status code to transfer SEO value to the new URL
  </Card>
  <Card title="Minimize redirect chains" icon="route">
    Each redirect dilutes SEO value - aim for direct redirects without intermediate steps
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid redirect loops" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Test for circular redirects that create infinite loops and prevent indexing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Preserve URL parameters" icon="gear">
    Ensure important parameters (like pagination, filters) survive redirects for proper indexing
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Common SEO issues

<Accordion title="Redirect chains">
**Problem:** Multiple redirects between old and new URLs dilute SEO value.

**Example:**
```
example.com/old-page
  → 301 → example.com/temporary-page
  → 301 → example.com/new-page
```

**Impact:** Search engines may not follow all redirects, resulting in lost rankings.

**Solution:** Update all old URLs to redirect directly to the final destination:
```
example.com/old-page
  → 301 → example.com/new-page
```

Use Redirect Trace to identify chains longer than 1 redirect, then update your redirect rules.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="302 vs 301 confusion">
**Problem:** Using temporary 302 redirects instead of permanent 301 redirects.

**Example:**
```
example.com/product-old-name
  → 302 Found
  → example.com/product-new-name
```

**Impact:** Search engines don't transfer page authority to the new URL, maintaining rankings on the old URL that no longer exists.

**Solution:** Change to 301 Moved Permanently:
```
example.com/product-old-name
  → 301 Moved Permanently
  → example.com/product-new-name
```

Trace your redirects regularly to ensure correct status codes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="HTTP to HTTPS redirect chains">
**Problem:** Multiple steps from HTTP to HTTPS due to www/non-www redirects.

**Example:**
```
http://example.com
  → 301 → http://www.example.com
  → 301 → https://www.example.com
```

**Impact:** Extra redirect adds latency and dilutes SEO signals.

**Solution:** Redirect directly from HTTP non-www to HTTPS www:
```
http://example.com
  → 301 → https://www.example.com
```

Configure your server to handle both redirects in a single step.
</Accordion>

### SEO audit workflow

1. **Crawl your site** - Use a site crawler to extract all URLs
2. **Identify redirected URLs** - Filter for pages that redirect (301, 302, etc.)
3. **Trace each redirect** - Use Redirect Trace to analyze the redirect chain
4. **Document issues** - Note chains longer than 1 redirect, incorrect status codes, or broken redirects
5. **Fix and verify** - Update redirect rules and re-trace to verify fixes

<Info>
Run this audit quarterly to catch new redirect chains introduced by site updates, migrations, or content changes.
</Info>

## Performance debugging

Debug slow page loads and performance issues caused by redirect chains.

### Performance impact of redirects

Each redirect adds:
- **DNS lookup** - 20-120ms for the next domain
- **TCP connection** - 50-200ms to establish connection
- **TLS handshake** - 50-250ms for HTTPS sites
- **HTTP request/response** - 50-500ms depending on server location

**Total per redirect:** 170-1,070ms of added latency

A chain with 3 redirects can add 500-3,000ms to page load time.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Mobile performance" icon="mobile">
    Mobile networks have higher latency - redirects hurt mobile users more than desktop users
  </Card>
  <Card title="International users" icon="globe">
    Redirects across geographic regions add significant latency for international visitors
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Debugging workflow

When users report slow page loads:

1. **Trace the problematic URL** - Copy the exact URL users are accessing
2. **Count redirects** - Check the redirect count in the summary
3. **Identify cross-domain redirects** - Look for redirects between different domains (adds DNS + connection time)
4. **Test from different locations** - If possible, test the same URL from different geographic regions
5. **Measure improvement** - After optimizing, trace again to verify fewer redirects

<Accordion title="Example: Debugging slow mobile page loads">
**Scenario:** Mobile users report your landing page is slow, but desktop users don't see issues.

**Investigation:**
1. Trace the landing page URL
2. Discover a 4-redirect chain:
   ```
   short.link/campaign
     → mobile-tracker.com/click?id=123
     → analytics-platform.com/track
     → yoursite.com/landing
   ```

3. On mobile networks (higher latency), each redirect takes 300-500ms
4. Total added latency: 900-2,000ms

**Solution:**
- Replace the URL shortener with a direct link
- Consolidate tracking to reduce redirect steps
- Result: 1 redirect instead of 3, saving 600-1,500ms on mobile
</Accordion>

## Redirect verification

Verify that your redirect implementation works correctly across different scenarios and edge cases.

### Test cases to verify

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Query parameters" icon="question">
    Verify that query parameters are preserved through redirects
  </Card>
  <Card title="URL fragments" icon="hashtag">
    Test that URL fragments (#section) are handled correctly
  </Card>
  <Card title="Special characters" icon="at">
    Check redirects with spaces, international characters, and symbols
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trailing slashes" icon="slash-forward">
    Verify consistent behavior with and without trailing slashes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Edge case testing

Test these edge cases with Redirect Trace:

```javascript
// Query parameter preservation
example.com/old?search=test&sort=date
  → Should redirect to → example.com/new?search=test&sort=date

// Multiple parameters
example.com/page?utm_source=email&utm_medium=newsletter&ref=campaign
  → Verify all parameters are preserved

// Encoded characters
example.com/search?q=hello%20world
  → Check that encoding is maintained

// Fragment identifiers
example.com/page#section-2
  → Note: Fragments are client-side and won't appear in server redirects
```

<Info>
URL fragments (#section) are not sent to the server, so they won't appear in Redirect Trace results. Browsers handle fragment navigation client-side after the final redirect completes.
</Info>

## Integration with development tools

Use Redirect Trace alongside your existing development workflow:

### CI/CD integration

Add redirect testing to your continuous integration pipeline:

1. **Deploy to staging** - Automated deployment after code merge
2. **Run redirect tests** - Script that traces critical URLs and verifies expected behavior
3. **Verify results** - Check redirect count, status codes, and final destinations
4. **Block deployment** - Fail the build if redirects don't match expectations

### Local development

Use Redirect Trace during local development:

- **Test localhost URLs** - Trace redirects in your local development environment
- **Debug proxy issues** - Verify that development proxies and tunnels redirect correctly
- **Test external integrations** - Check how third-party services redirect back to your local server

### Monitoring and alerts

Set up monitoring to catch redirect changes:

1. **Baseline your redirects** - Trace all important URLs and document expected redirect chains
2. **Regular checks** - Weekly or monthly, re-trace the same URLs
3. **Alert on changes** - Flag when redirect count increases or final destination changes
4. **Investigate differences** - Use Redirect Trace to understand what changed

<Info>
Create a test suite of your most important URLs (homepage, product pages, checkout) and trace them regularly to catch unexpected redirect changes before they impact users.
