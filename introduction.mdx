Redirect Trace helps with multiple workflows:

### Security

Detect phishing attempts, prevent malware, and verify legitimate vs malicious redirects before clicking unknown links.

### Marketing

Analyze campaign redirect paths, find unnecessary redirects slowing down links, and inspect UTM parameters to see what tracking data is being collected.

### Development

Test redirect behavior in applications, check for redirect chains affecting SEO, and identify slow or broken redirects during debugging.

## What you'll see

When you trace a URL, Redirect Trace provides:
