Redirect Trace provides three convenient methods to trace URL redirects. Choose the method that best fits your workflow.

## Three methods to trace URLs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Method 1: Search bar">
    The quickest way to trace a URL is by typing or pasting it directly into the search bar.

    1. Open Redirect Trace in Raycast
    2. Type or paste any URL in the search bar
    3. Press Enter to trace the redirect chain
    4. View the complete path from original to final destination

    <Note>
      This method works best for URLs under 500 characters. For longer URLs, use the clipboard detection method.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Method 2: Clipboard detection">
    Redirect Trace automatically detects long URLs in your clipboard when you open the extension.

    1. Copy any long URL to your clipboard (500+ characters)
    2. Open Redirect Trace
    3. If a long URL is detected, you'll see a clipboard section
    4. Click "Trace This URL" to analyze the redirect chain

    <Tip>
      The extension displays the character count and a preview of clipboard URLs, making it easy to confirm you're tracing the right link.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Method 3: Keyboard shortcuts">
    Use keyboard shortcuts for faster workflow without leaving your keyboard.

    - **⌘V** - Check clipboard for URLs manually
    - **⌘C** - Copy final URL after tracing
    - **⌘O** - Open final URL in browser
    - **⌘⇧C** - Copy original URL
    - **⌘⌥C** - Copy full chain report

    <Note>
      For a complete list of all keyboard shortcuts, see the [keyboard shortcuts reference](/usage/keyboard-shortcuts).
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What you'll see after tracing

After tracing a URL, Redirect Trace displays comprehensive information organized into sections:

### Summary section

- **Original URL** - The URL you entered with character count
- **Final destination** - Where the URL actually leads
- **Clean URL** - Final URL with tracking parameters removed
- **Redirect count** - Number of redirects in the chain

### Redirect chain section

Each step in the chain shows:

- **HTTP status code** - 301, 302, 307, etc.
- **Status message** - Moved Permanently, Found, etc.
- **URL at each step** - Complete redirect path
- **Headers** - Response headers for each redirect
- **Step number** - Position in the redirect chain

<Tip>
  You can copy individual URLs, headers, or the entire chain report using keyboard shortcuts or the action panel.
</Tip>

## Supported URL types

Redirect Trace works with any HTTP/HTTPS URL, including:

- **Shortened URLs** - bit.ly, tinyurl.com, t.co, etc.
- **Marketing links** - Email campaign URLs with tracking
- **Tracking URLs** - URLs with UTM parameters
- **Social media** - Facebook, Twitter redirect URLs
- **Any web link** - Direct analysis of any HTTP/HTTPS URL
