description: How to handle URLs with 500+ characters using clipboard detection in Redirect Trace
---

Redirect Trace includes special handling for long URLs (500+ characters) to ensure reliable tracing without input field limitations.

## Why clipboard detection for long URLs?

URLs with 500 or more characters can cause issues when pasted directly into search fields:

- **Input field limitations** - Some UI frameworks truncate long inputs
- **Performance issues** - Real-time tracing on input change can be slower with very long URLs
- **Display problems** - Extremely long URLs are difficult to verify in a search bar
- **Clipboard reliability** - Reading from clipboard is more reliable than form inputs for large strings

<Note>
  The 500-character threshold was chosen to balance convenience (most URLs work in the search bar) with reliability (very long URLs use clipboard detection).
</Note>

## How clipboard detection works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automatic detection">
    When you open Redirect Trace, the extension automatically checks your clipboard for long URLs.

    - Extension reads clipboard content on launch
    - Checks if content is a URL (starts with `http://` or `https://`)
    - Checks if URL length exceeds 500 characters
    - Displays detection notification if conditions are met

    <Tip>
      The notification shows the URL length in kilobytes (e.g., "0.8k characters") to help you gauge the URL size.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clipboard URL section">
    When a long URL is detected, a dedicated section appears at the top of the list.

    The clipboard section displays:
    - **Character count** - Total number of characters
    - **URL preview** - First 100 characters of the URL
    - **Size indicator** - Character count in kilobytes
    - **Trace action** - Button to start tracing

    Example display:
    ```
    📋 Paste Long URL From Clipboard
    800 characters - https://example.com/very-long-url...
    0.8k chars
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manual clipboard check">
    If automatic detection doesn't trigger, you can manually check your clipboard.

    1. Copy your long URL
    2. Open Redirect Trace
    3. Navigate to "For Very Long URLs" item in the "How to Use" section
    4. Press **⌘V** or select "Check Clipboard for Long URLs"

    <Note>
      Manual checking is useful if you copied the URL after opening the extension, or if automatic detection failed.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trace the URL">
    Once detected, trace the long URL with a single action.

    1. Press Enter on "Trace This URL" item
    2. Or press **⌘V** to check clipboard and trace automatically
    3. Wait for tracing to complete (may take a few seconds for very long URLs)
    4. View results in the summary and redirect chain sections

    <Tip>
      Long URLs may take slightly longer to process. You'll see an animated toast notification showing progress.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working with very long URLs

### Character count thresholds

Redirect Trace displays character counts differently based on URL length:

| Length | Display Format | Example |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| < 100 chars | Exact count | `87 chars` |
| 100-999 chars | Exact count | `650 chars` |
| 1000+ chars | Kilobytes | `1.2k chars` |

### Performance considerations

When tracing very long URLs:

- **Processing time** - URLs over 500 characters show a "Processing Long URL" toast
- **Network timeouts** - Longer URLs may trigger timeout settings faster
- **Memory usage** - Very long redirect chains with long URLs consume more memory

<Note>
  You can adjust timeout settings in Raycast preferences if long URLs consistently time out.
</Note>

## Common scenarios for long URLs

### Marketing campaign URLs

Email marketing tools often generate extremely long URLs with extensive tracking parameters:

```
https://example.com/landing?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=summer_2024&utm_content=cta_button_1&subscriber_id=abc123def456&email_id=campaign_789&tracking_token=veryLongRandomString123456789...
```

**Solution:** Use clipboard detection to trace these URLs and copy the clean URL without tracking parameters.

### Encoded redirect URLs

Some services encode entire URLs as parameters, creating very long redirect chains:

```
https://redirect.example.com?url=https%3A%2F%2Fanother-site.com%2Fpath%3Fparam1%3Dvalue1%26param2%3Dvalue2%26param3%3Dvalue3...
```

**Solution:** Clipboard detection handles these URLs reliably, showing you the decoded chain at each step.

### Social media share URLs

Social media platforms add tracking and metadata to shared links:

```
https://facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Foriginal-site.com%2Farticle&h=AT0a1b2c3d4e5f...&s=1&enc=...&additional_params...
```

**Solution:** Copy the social media URL and use clipboard detection to trace to the original destination.

## Keyboard shortcuts for clipboard URLs

When working with clipboard-detected URLs:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **⌘V** | Check clipboard manually |
| **⌘C** | Copy full clipboard URL |
| **⌘X** | Clear clipboard detection |
| **Enter** | Trace the detected URL |

<Tip>
  After tracing a long URL, use **⌘⇧L** to copy the clean version without tracking parameters, which is often much shorter.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting clipboard detection

### Clipboard not detected automatically

**Possible causes:**
- URL is under 500 characters (use search bar instead)
- Clipboard doesn't contain a valid HTTP/HTTPS URL
- Extension opened before URL was copied

**Solution:** Use manual clipboard check with **⌘V** after copying the URL.

### Clipboard cleared unexpectedly

**Possible causes:**
- Another app modified clipboard
- System clipboard history interfered

**Solution:** Copy the URL again and use manual clipboard check.

### URL too long error

**Possible causes:**
- URL exceeds system clipboard limits (very rare)
- URL contains invalid characters causing parsing issues

**Solution:** Try shortening the URL by removing obvious tracking parameters manually first, then trace the cleaner version.
